# About the project

## Backend made with **Nodejs/express** using **Mysql** as a database and **sequelize** for the ORM

# Instructions

## Backend

Start by going in the backend folder with **__'cd backend'__** and install all the dependencies with **__'npm install'__**

You will need to add a .env file in the root folder with these key:
- [ ] sequelizeDb='name of your schema'
- [ ] sequelizeUser='your Mysql user name'
- [ ] sequelizePassword='your Mysql password'
- [ ] secretToken='your secret token'

You can then run the server with **__'npm run start'__**, or you can install nodemon if you intend to make some changes.
