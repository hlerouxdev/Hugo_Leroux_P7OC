# About the project

### The backend was made with **Nodejs/express** using **Mysql** as a database and **sequelize** for the ORM.
### The frontend is yet to be done and will use Vuejs

# Instructions

## Backend

- [ ] Start by going in the backend folder with **'cd backend'** and install all the dependencies with **'npm install'**

- [ ] Add a .env file in the root folder with these keys:
  - sequelizeDb='name of your schema'
  - sequelizeUser='your Mysql user name'
  - sequelizePassword='your Mysql password'
  - secretToken='your secret token'
 
- [ ] Add an **"image"** folder in the "backend" folder to store the images.

- [ ] You can then run the server with **'npm run start'**. 

- [ ] If you intend to make some changes I suggest installing [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).
