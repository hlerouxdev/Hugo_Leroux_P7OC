# About the project

## The backend was made with **Nodejs/express** using **Mysql** as a database and **sequelize** for the ORM.
## The frontend is yet to be done and will use Vuejs

# Instructions

## Backend

Start by going in the backend folder with **'cd backend'** and install all the dependencies with **'npm install'**

You will need to add a .env file in the root folder with these key:
- [ ] sequelizeDb='name of your schema'
- [ ] sequelizeUser='your Mysql user name'
- [ ] sequelizePassword='your Mysql password'
- [ ] secretToken='your secret token'

You can then run the server with **'npm run start'**. 

If you intend to make some changes I suggest installing [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).
